Python version used : 3.7
Conda version: 4.5.12

We have total of 8 files. 3 files are for Bag of Words, 3 are for TF-IDF, 2 automated unit test case file.
Files Included:
authorship_BOW_KNN.py
authorship_BOW_TREE.py
authorship_BOW_SVC.py
authorship_TF-IDF_KNN.py
authorship_TF-IDF_TREE.py
authorship_TF-IDF_SVC.py
Unit_Testing_BOW.py
Unit_Testing_TF_IDF.py

Below are the steps to run the code of Authorship for Bag of words and TF-IDF.

1. Choose any file from the above mentioned names in the submission folder.
2. Open the file in any of your IDE of python. (e.g. we used Spyder from Anaconda)
3. The file needs to be changed for the file location.
4. Look for variable name : 'fileLoc' in the file.
5. Replace the value of the 'fileLoc' variable with your system location.
   We have placed every book in separate folder. (3 separate folders)
6. Depending upon the Laptop you have choose your path format.
   Windows : C:\\Users\\Hp\\EBC7100\\FirstBook\\a.txt
   Mac : /Users/Hp/EBC7100/FirstBook/a.txt
7. Once you have created the same folder path in your system, add the same path in the value of 'fileLoc'.
8. Run the code. You can use play button to run or select all text and use keyboard shortcut (shift+Enter)
9. Code will run and will produce the output with accuracy of 10-fold cross validation and mean of the prediction.
10. You will also see the 2 visualizations based on our result.
11. We have 2 unit testing files one is for BOW and one is for TF-IDF.
12. Run the Unit_Testing_XXX.py from mentioned above files and validate the output at last.

Note: Make sure to change the variable fileLoc in all of the 6 files mentioned above.
      Also after each run you need to remove the files from the respective folder to make the next file run error free.
